            <h1>Why Comprehensive Sex Education Matters in the Philippines</h1>
            <p>
                Comprehensive sex education (CSE) in the Philippines helps young people learn about their bodies, relationships, and how to stay healthy. It gives them information and skills they need so teenage pregnancy can be avoided, and it helps them make better choices. In 2018, the Department of Education put guidelines so that CSE is taught in schools from Kindergarten to Grade 12(Education Profiles, 2018).  
            </p>
            <p>
                Recent data shows teenage pregnancy dropped from 8.6% in 2017 to 5.4% in 2022 among girls aged 15-19 because more education and health services are becoming available(Philippine Statistics Authority, 2023).

            <h1>About Comprehensive Sex Education</h1>
            <p>
                Comprehensive Sex Education (CSE) is more than just learning about the body. 
                It covers relationships, respect, responsibility, and values that help guide 
                young people to make healthy decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the Philippines, CSE is important because it helps address issues such as 
                teen pregnancy, gender respect, and awareness of health and safety. By learning 
                accurate information, students are better prepared to face real-life challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our mission is to create awareness and promote safe and respectful practices 
                among students, families, and communities.
